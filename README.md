Remember that when starting a vagrant image, the directory containing the Vagrantfile will be mounted as /vagrant in the started image
This will give you an easy way to make an updated .deb avaialable, for example.

As root, run 

    ./vagrant-tidy.sh

Exit from the VM and run

    vagrant package

This will create package.box - Go to https://app.vagrantup.com/projectreshare/boxes/development and create a new version with provider virtualbox then
upload the new .box image.
